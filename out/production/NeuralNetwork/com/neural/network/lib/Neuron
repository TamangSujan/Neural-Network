In neural network, each input has its own weight value to corresponding neuron.
That corresponding neuron has a bias value injected.

It means every different corresponding neuron has different weight value.

A Tensor is an object which can be represented as array in AI.

Inputs are vector
Weights are matrix vector
Outputs are vector

Kinda a fun fact:
    Output = Weight * Input + Bias
    y = mx + b
    Y = Result
    M = Slope
    X = Input
    B/C = Constant

    Bias is for Offset, as without Bias or Constant, we cannot offset to some point
